#  F# Image Processing Pipelines: Core Types & Patterns

We are working with asynchronous computation. 

##  Data Abstraction Layers

###  1. `'T` - **Concrete Value**

This is your ordinary value. For example:

```fsharp
let x: int = 42
```

No computation or delay involved.

#### What is unit?
`'T = unit` means "no meaningful value" - like void in other languages. It's used for:

- Indicating side effects,

- Placeholder return values,

- Control flow (e.g. in loops or task pipelines).

---

###  2. `Async<'T>` - **Single Async Computation**

This represents a **computation** that *will eventually produce* a value of type `'T`.

* Think of it as a task or a promise in other languages (like `Task<'T>` in C# or `Promise<T>` in JS).
* The computation may involve I/O, threading, etc.

Example:

```fsharp
let getIntAsync: Async<int> =
    async { return 42 }
```

To *extract* the value, you need to **run it**:

```fsharp
let value = Async.RunSynchronously getIntAsync  // value = 42
```

#### What is `Async<unit>`?
`Async<unit>` means:

> **An asynchronous operation** that completes in the future and produces *no meaningful result*.

Examples:

```fsharp
async { do! someSideEffect(); return () } : Async<unit>
```


---

###  3. `AsyncSeq<'T>` - **Sequence of Async Values**

Represents **a sequence of values over time**. This is like a lazy `seq<'T>`, but asynchronous.
This models *both time and structure* - but in practice:

* The *structure* is the sequence (`[]`, `[x]`, `[x; y]`, …)
* The *time* is when each value becomes available
* Each element may be delayed, fetched from disk/network, etc.

So for clarity:

*  `Async<'T>` -> *time-only* (delayed single value)
*  `AsyncSeq<'T>` -> *structured data arriving over time*


Example:

```fsharp
let nums: AsyncSeq<int> =
    asyncSeq {
        yield 1
        do! Async.Sleep 1000
        yield 2
    }
```

#### What is `AsyncSeq<unit>`?
`AsyncSeq<unit>` means:

> **A sequence of asynchronous steps**, each step producing a `unit`.
> So it represents **a structured stream of side-effects**.

Think of it like a pipeline where each item doesn't carry data - it's just there to represent *a step*, e.g.:

```fsharp
asyncSeq {
    do! someIO ()
    yield ()         // Step 1
    do! someMore ()
    yield ()         // Step 2
}
```

Use Cases for `AsyncSeq<unit>`

This is common when you:

* Process a stream for **side effects only**, not results,
* Discard intermediate values but keep track of structure,
* Want to synchronize execution without emitting values.

#### Example:

In your context:

```fsharp
run pipe : AsyncSeq<unit>
```

This means: "run this pipeline - it has side effects, but no result values."

---

###  4. `Pipe<'S, 'T>` - **Stream Transformer Over Structured Async Data**

A `Pipe<'S, 'T>` represents a **stream processor** that transforms a sequence of type `'S` into a sequence of type `'T`, while preserving the asynchronous nature of the data.

It wraps the transformation:

```fsharp
AsyncSeq<'S> -> AsyncSeq<'T>
```

So it's **not just a function** - it's a *composable building block* that also carries:

* A **name** (for debugging / tracing),
* A **memory profile** (Streaming, Sliding, Buffered, Constant),
* An **execution model** via the `Apply` field.

---

####  Structure + Time + Context

We can think of a `Pipe<'S, 'T>` as a higher-level abstraction over `AsyncSeq<'S>`:

| Aspect        | Meaning in `Pipe<'S, 'T>`                                                          |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Structure** | The transformation preserves or reshapes the stream - map, filter, windowing, etc. |
| **Time**      | Each value in the stream may arrive asynchronously                                 |
| **Context**   | The `Pipe` may manage memory profiles, disk IO, or composition                     |

> `Pipe<'S, 'T>` transforms structured asynchronous data (`AsyncSeq<'S>`) into new structured asynchronous data (`AsyncSeq<'T>`), with added metadata and composition tools.

It's a **streaming computation**, aware of:

* **Timing** (via async values),
* **Structure** (sequences over time),
* **Resources** (via memory profiles).

####  What is `Pipe<unit, 'T>`?

This is a pipeline that takes **no input**, and **produces** a stream of `'T`. It represents a **producer**, **generator**, or a **data source**.

It is analogous to:

```fsharp
unit -> AsyncSeq<'T>
```

---

####  What is `Pipe<'T, unit>`?

This is the **dual**: it takes a stream of `'T` and **produces nothing** - or more precisely, it **consumes** the input.

It corresponds to:

```fsharp
AsyncSeq<'T> -> AsyncSeq<unit>
```

But more semantically:

>  `Pipe<'T, unit>` is a **Sink** - a consumer.

| Pipe Type        | Interpretation  | Analogous to                                   |
| ---------------- | --------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `Pipe<unit, 'T>` | **Source**      | `unit -> AsyncSeq<'T>`                         |
| `Pipe<'T, unit>` | **Sink**        | `AsyncSeq<'T> -> Async<unit>` (after reducing) |
| `Pipe<'A, 'B>`   | **Transformer** | `AsyncSeq<'A> -> AsyncSeq<'B>`                 |

---

####  How is `Pipe<'T, unit>` used?

Often, these are terminal operations in your pipeline:

* `print : Pipe<'T, unit>`
* `ignore : Pipe<'T, unit>`
* `saveToDisk : Pipe<Slice<'T>, unit>`

They're often passed to `sink`, e.g.:

```fsharp
myPipe >=> print |> sink
```

| Type             | Role          | Description                         |
| ---------------- | ------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `Pipe<unit, 'T>` | **Source**    | Produces data without needing input |
| `Pipe<'T, unit>` | **Sink**      | Consumes data, no further output    |
| `Pipe<'A, 'B>`   | **Processor** | General stream transformer          |

---

###  `Operation<'S,'T>` - Pipeline Stage With Memory Profile Planning

An `Operation<'S, 'T>` wraps a `Pipe<'S, 'T>` with **planning information**:

```fsharp
type Stage<'S,'T> =
  { Name       : string
    Transition : MemoryTransition
    Pipe       : Pipe<'S,'T> }
```

Use it when:

* You need to compose pipelines with **explicit control** over memory usage.
* You want to check **transition compatibility** between stages (e.g. Sliding -> Streaming).
* You're planning for **3D windowed operations** or full-buffer transforms.

It preserves the `Pipe` interface, but enables smart graph validation.

---

###  `MemoryTransition`

Encapsulates how an operation **expects** memory to be shaped across the pipeline.

```fsharp
type MemoryTransition =
  { From  : MemoryProfile
    To    : MemoryProfile
    Check : SliceShape -> bool }
```

Used to ensure compatibility between composed `Operation`s:

```fsharp
validate op1 op2
```

---
## Data Relations
Async<'T> defines a Monad, AsyncSeq<'T> a stream of Monads, and Pipe<'S,'T> a stream transformer or a morphism. This may be called a Kleisli category over morphisms.

###  `'T -> Async<'T>`

* **Monad's `return` / `pure`**
* Wraps a plain value in the minimal effect
* **No transformation**, just lifting

```fsharp
async.Return x  // 'T -> Async<'T>
```

---

###  `Async<'T> -> 'T`

* **Reducer / evaluator of async**
* Extracts value from the effect
* Loses laziness or concurrency

```fsharp
Async.RunSynchronously : Async<'T> -> 'T
```

---

###  `'T -> Async<'U>`

* **Effectful mapper / Kleisli arrow**
* Applies a function *that introduces* asynchronous behavior or IO

This is the **core of "monadic bind"**:

```fsharp
let bind (f: 'T -> Async<'U>) (x: Async<'T>) : Async<'U> =
    async {
        let! t = x
        return! f t
    }
```

*Think of this as a mapper with side effects or delayed computations.*

---

###  `Async<'T> -> 'U`

* This is **not a standard monadic construct**
* Conceptually, this **breaks** the monad
* You're running the async and extracting a value - it's *interpreting* the effect

So:

* It **looks like a reducer** of the monad.
* But **unlike `reduce`**, it typically means you're collapsing the async structure early.
* It's generally not composable (not pure) and ties you to evaluation strategies.

**Examples:**

```fsharp
let asyncToValue : Async<int> -> int = Async.RunSynchronously
```

---

###  What does `Async<'U> -> AsyncSeq<'T>` mean?

It's a function that:

* **Waits for an asynchronous result** of type `'U`,
* And then **starts emitting a stream** of `'T` values.

---

####  Conceptually, it is:

| Perspective           | Interpretation                                                                    |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Monad Perspective** | A function *from a single promise to a stream* - it lifts time into structure.    |
| **Producer**          | A stream **generator** based on the result of a one-time async computation.       |
| **Dual to `reduce`**  | If `AsyncSeq<'T> -> Async<'U>` is a *reduction* (fold), then this is *expansion*. |
| **"Unfolding"**       | Like `unfoldAsync` but with the seed coming from an async computation.            |
| **Stream Builder**    | It transforms a future into a source of many values.                              |

---

####  Example Use Case

```fsharp
let fetchAndStream (asyncData: Async<string>) : AsyncSeq<char> =
    asyncSeq {
        let! data = asyncData
        for c in data do
            yield c
    }
```

Here, we wait for a string to arrive (an `Async<string>`) and turn it into a stream of characters (`AsyncSeq<char>`).

---

####  Possible Names or Roles

Although no single canonical name exists, here are reasonable terms:

* **UnfoldAsync**-style transformer
* **Stream generator**
* **Async-to-stream adapter**
* **Delayed source**
* **AsyncExpander**
* **StreamifyAsync** (in library naming)

---

####  Not a Kleisli Arrow

* Kleisli arrows are of the form `'A -> M<'B>` for *some monad* `M`.
* This is **not** such a form because `Async<'U>` is already inside a monad.

---


### What About `AsyncSeq<'T> -> Async<'U>`?

This is a **structural reduction**:

####  It's a **general consumption of the stream**:

* Aggregation (`fold`, `reduce`)
* Summarization (e.g., `mean`, `min`, `max`)
* Exporting data (e.g., writing to disk)
* Side-effectful execution (e.g., `printAsync`)

**Why confusing?** Because it *looks* like you're mapping (`'T -> 'U`), but you're:

* **consuming many items**
* **producing a single result**
* and doing it **asynchronously**

```fsharp
// E.g., mean over stream
let computeMean (stream: AsyncSeq<float>) : Async<float> = async {
    let! items = stream |> AsyncSeq.toListAsync
    return List.average items
}
```
---

###  Why `'T -> AsyncSeq<'U>` is Special

* It differs from `'T -> 'U` because it **produces multiple results** (zero or more), not just one.
* In monad terms, it's equivalent to `flatMap` or `bind`.
* This enables **dynamic expansion**: one slice in, many slices out.
* Key for operations like `windowing`, `duplication`, or **scatter/gather**.

---

###  What is `AsyncSeq<'T> -> Pipe<'U, 'V>`?

#### What does this mean?

This would be a function that, **given a stream**, constructs a `Pipe`.

But this **doesn't make sense in general**, because a `Pipe` is **not built from a concrete stream** - it is a **function that transforms a stream**, not one constructed *from* a stream.

####  Valid Specialized Interpretation

You could imagine something like:

```fsharp
let injectStream (external: AsyncSeq<'T>) : Pipe<unit, 'T>
```

Which **wraps a fixed stream** as a pipeline - effectively a **source**.

This is what your `source` and `lift` do:

* It turns `AsyncSeq<'T>` into a `Pipe<unit, 'T>`

This is equivalent to **embedding a static stream** into a pipeline:

```fsharp
let sourceFromStream name stream =
  { Name = name; Profile = Streaming; Apply = fun _ -> stream }
```

So:

>  `AsyncSeq<'T> -> Pipe<unit, 'T>`
> is like a **stream source**.

---

###  And what is the inverse `Pipe<'U, 'V> -> AsyncSeq<'T>`?

#### What does this mean?

You have a stream transformer, and you want to turn it into an **actual stream**. This requires an **input stream**, i.e., `Pipe.Apply : AsyncSeq<'U> -> AsyncSeq<'V>`.

You already have:

```fsharp
let run (p: Pipe<unit, 'T>) : AsyncSeq<'T> =
    p.Apply (AsyncSeq.singleton ())
```

So:

> `Pipe<unit, 'T> -> AsyncSeq<'T>` is a **pipeline runner** for pipelines that take no stream input.

If you have `Pipe<'U, 'V>`, then you must supply a stream of `'U` to get a stream of `'V`.

---
###  Core Relationship: `Pipe<'S,'T>` vs. `AsyncSeq<'T>`

- `AsyncSeq<'T>` is a **value**

       - A lazy, asynchronous sequence of elements of type `'T`
       - It's *data* in an effectful context

-  `Pipe<'S,'T>` is a **computation**

       - A **transformer** from an `AsyncSeq<'S>` -> `AsyncSeq<'T>`
       - Encapsulates:
              - A **name**
              - A **memory profile**
              - An `Apply` function

| -------------- | ---------------- | -------------------------- |

| `run: Pipe<unit,'T> -> AsyncSeq<'T>` | Execute pipeline          | Realize Stream          |

> So, `AsyncSeq<'T> -> Async<'U>` is a **reduction over structure**, producing a **summary**.

##  `Pipe<'S,'T>` as a First-Class Computation and more

A `Pipe` is:

```fsharp
type Pipe<'S,'T> =
  {
    Name: string
    Profile: MemoryProfile
    Apply: AsyncSeq<'S> -> AsyncSeq<'T>
  }
```

So it's:

* A **wrapped function** from `AsyncSeq<'S>` to `AsyncSeq<'T>`
* But also **metadata-aware** (`Profile`) and **debuggable** (`Name`)
* It's your system's **domain-specific Kleisli arrow**

---

> The pipeline layer **abstracts the streaming context** and **enables composition**, in the same way a monad abstracts and controls effects.

---

##  Example

Let's say you have this:

```fsharp
let normalizeSlice (slice: Slice<float>) : Slice<float> = ...
```

If you want to apply it to every streamed slice, you lift it:

```fsharp
let normalize : Pipe<Slice<float>, Slice<float>> =
  lift "normalize" Streaming (fun s -> async.Return (normalizeSlice s))
```

Then you can compose:

```fsharp
source >=> normalize >=> filter >=> print
```

All without seeing `AsyncSeq` - *it's hidden in the plumbing.*

---

##  Monad close terminology

From a **monadic** perspective:

* `Async<'T>` is a monad over time.
* `AsyncSeq<'T>` is a monad over time *and* order - it's like `List` + `Async`.

Both allow you to:

* Lift a pure `'T` into their context (`async.Return`, `AsyncSeq.singleton`)
* Compose computations (`let!`, `bind`, etc.)

Use
* **`reduce`** for `AsyncSeq<'T> -> Async<'R>`
* **`collect`** or **`toList`** for `AsyncSeq<'T> -> Async<'T list>`
* **`aggregate`** if you want something more general

| Async Mapper       | `'T -> Async<'U>`                                 | Transformation requiring asynchronous context        |
| Stream Mapper      | `AsyncSeq<'T> -> AsyncSeq<'U>`                    | Whole-stream transformation                          |
| FlatMap / Binder   | `'T -> AsyncSeq<'U>`                              | Emits **0 or more** results per input (monadic bind) |
| Reducer            | `AsyncSeq<'T> -> Async<'U>`                       | Collapses a stream into a single result              |
| Batch Reducer      | `AsyncSeq<'T> -> Async<'T list>` or similar       | Gathers stream into a list                           |
| Pipe (stream proc) | `Pipe<'S, 'T>`                                    | Stream transformer, used in composition              |
| Scalar Injector    | `Pipe<'In, 'A> -> Pipe<'In, 'B> -> Pipe<'In, 'C>` | Merges scalar and stream (e.g. via `zipWith`)        |
